 ## Packaging and Style

 The style of this web site mimics Acorn Software Products initial, efficient packaging. The design worked for mail order delivery of programs and for our small number of retail outlets. Documentation was black ink on goldenrod paper folded in half to 8.5 x 5.5 inches. This and the medium, cassette or diskette, was inserted into a plastic sleeve with a printed cardstock backer that was 9 7/8 x 5 3/4 inches. On the top 1 1/2 inch of the yellow backer in a brown ink was printed the large Acorn logo, the words "Acorn Software Products, Inc.", plus "TRS-80 PROGRAMS" with a Tandy Trademark notice. The later wording was changed for Atari Computer programs.

For this site, the max-width is set to 5 3/4 inches with the same bright yellow background as the cardstock. The top 1 1/2 inches contains the logo and "Acorn Software Products, Inc." with a dark brown, san-serif font. The site navigation subsitutes for "TRS-80 Programs". The "documentation" container has a background of #fc0 which more closely resembles the goldenrod paper Acorn used. As was typical for 1979, a small copyright notice is added as footer.
